# edX Learning Dashboard

> 1st Prize Winner for [edX Learning Dashboard Challenge 2015](https://open.edx.org/blog/edx-learning-dashboard-challenge) ([Live Demo](http://zachguo.github.io/edx-learning-dashboard-challenge))

## Overview

- `Progress` is a donut chart showing section-based progress of current student (in comparison to peers)
- `Timeline` is a line chart tracking a student's progress from the beginning to the end of the course, in comparison to his/her goal, which can either be getting a certificate (certificate line), completing all problems(100% line), or watching all video(100% line)
- `Leaderboard` is a bar chart showcasing the top performers
- Implicit cues rather than explicit verbal suggestions are used to guide and encourage students.
  - in `Progress` chart, a smooth colorful ring looks better than a gray rugged ring, and student can achieve a beautiful ring by making more and balanced efforts;
  - in `Timeline` chart, x-axis punchcard be a perfect green line if the user can spend 15+ minutes on the website everyday;
  - `Leaderboard` directly shows the behaviors that are praised.
- Visualization logics and data logics are separated. JS scripts contains minimal codes for data manipulation, and simply read and show all JSON data generated by `csv2json.py`.
- `D3.js` is the only dependency for visualizations

## Style

- mimicking the native style as in EDX course page
- light, concise, straightforward, avoiding information overload
- meaningful animations (every animation serves a purpose)
- responsive design (though hover effects are limited on small touch screen)
- tested working on latest Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE
  - the width of svg is a bit off in Safari, causing by a `offsetWidth` bug (possible to be fixed by JQuery).
